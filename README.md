# RV-ERE-Python
Repo created to share my CS6156 project on extending pythonrv with ERE functionality

Instructions for running the code artifacts in this repo:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Make sure your interpreter is set to Python 2.7
3. Make sure all packages are installed
4. You should be able to run thread-safe-specs directly in your IDE or with Python, look at the results from both the exceptions and also in the log generated by pythonrv, there should be a single lock violation
5. Change the for-loop conditions to measure the different amounts of time for the overhead data (Note depending on your machine specs this may run faster/slower)

Instructions for running the Six testing:
1. Download the git repo for six from here: https://github.com/benjaminp/six
2. In the newly cloned six folder, drop in the folder for EREMachine from this git repo
3. Also add six_specs and init_machine_six
4. You can either use the version of six_tests I have in this repo, or if you would like to use the current version, paste in the imports from this test version and also the first two tests involving the init_machine functions, as calling them sets up the statemachine
5. Run the tests normally in pytests
