# RV-ERE-Python
Repo created to share my CS6156 project on extending pythonrv with ERE functionality

Instructions for running the code artifacts in this repo:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Make sure your interpreter is set to Python 2.7
3. Make sure all packages are installed
4. You should be able to run thread-safe-specs directly in your IDE or with Python, look at the results from both the exceptions and also in the log generated by pythonrv, there should be a single lock violation
5. Change the for-loop conditions to measure the different amounts of time for the overhead data (Note depending on your machine specs this may run faster/slower)

Instructions for running the Six testing:
1. Download the git repo for six from here: https://github.com/benjaminp/six
2. In the six folder, add both the folder for EREMachine
